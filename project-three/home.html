			In <i class="has-text-primary">Slipstream</i>, you play as an ace pilot working for the 
			galactic empire; you have been tasked to test an experimental warp drive which uses naturally generated wormholes 
			for transportation. The only problem is that if you don't have the necessary fuel, you'll get ripped to shreds.<br><br>
			Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to fly your ship through the debris produced by the wormhole, 
			and collect enough fuel to make the warp jump before three minutes pass. You <i>could</i> stick around longer, but 'dimensional collapse' 
			should remain out of your volcabulary for as long as possible.<br>
			It's top secret, so nobody knows you're here. Luckily, that also means radio transmissions are being monitored even <i>LESS</i> than they already were.<br>
			Might as well listen to something you want, relax, and try to focus...
